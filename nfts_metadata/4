  "description": "The Springfield is a bolt-action rifle that served as the service rifle of the United States armed forces for the first half of the 20th century, designed to emulate the successful Mauser bolt-action rifle designs. The Springfield's design adopted many of Mauser's contemporary rifle features of the time, though it also did feature several original Springfield Armory design alterations such as a two-piece firing pin.",
